# Rust_lessons
 [Telegram group](https://t.me/+7xR7jaQmbrRkMzM0)

This repository designed as a Rust programming language tutorial.
You can find out how to use this tutorial and what topics does it cover in this README.md file.

## Structure

This tutorial is designed as a repository where each lesson is created as a seperate folder.

- Under each section folder, you can find a `README.md` which explains the concepts that is used in that section.
- Unders `src` folder, you can also find the code that is used in that section's explanation (used in README.md).
- Also in each section, you will find a task that can help you to understand the concept better. For the first timers, Rust may feel a little bit odd or new so having some hands on experience helps tremendously.

## Preliminary Requirements

This tutorial will explain Rust as a programming language, it **does not teach programming**.
My recommendation to follow this tutorial is that you already know some other programming language that you have some experience.
Also, Rust is a low level programming language. So, I would suggest, this tutorial would be more helpful if you already know using terminal/command line and git.

## Getting Started

1. Install Rust on your machine following the instructions on the [official Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).
2. Clone this repository to your local machine.

```
git clone https://github.com/SimonYuvarlak/Rust_lessons.git
```

3. Navigate to the module you want to study and read the README file.
4. Open the Rust code files in your preferred editor, read the comments, and run/modify the code to see how it works.
