# **Student Task: Exploring Rust Fundamentals**

#### **Task Overview**

Using the knowledge gained from the "Introduction to Rust Programming" section of the tutorial, your task is to create a small Rust program that combines these concepts. This exercise will help you solidify your understanding of Rust's basic syntax, data types, and functions.

#### **Task Description**

1. **Create a Rust Program:**

   - Start by setting up a new Rust project using Cargo.

2. **Implement the Following Features:**

   - **Variable Mutability:**

     - Declare two integer variables, one mutable and one immutable.
     - Try changing the value of both and observe the compiler's response.

   - **Explore Data Types:**

     - Create variables for each data type discussed (Integers, Floats, Boolean, Character, Tuple, Array).
     - Print each variable to the console.

   - **Custom Function:**
     - Write a function named `calculate_area` that takes two `i32` parameters, `width` and `height`.
     - The function should return the area as an `i32`.
     - In the `main` function, call `calculate_area` with some values and print the result.

3. **Experiment with Control Flow:**
   - Write a simple `if-else` statement that checks if a number (of your choice) is even or odd.
   - Implement a `for` loop that iterates over an array of numbers and prints each number.

#### **Expected Output**

Your program should compile without errors and print the results of each operation to the console. Here's an example of what the output might look like:

```
Immutable x: 5
Mutable y after change: 32
Integer: 42, Float: 3.14, Boolean: true, Character: 'R'
Tuple: (1, 2.2, 'a'), First element of Array: 'Monday'
Area of 5x4 is 20
2 is even
Array elements: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

This task is designed to be a practical application of the fundamental concepts of Rust. It will help reinforce your understanding and provide a hands-on experience with the language. Good luck!
