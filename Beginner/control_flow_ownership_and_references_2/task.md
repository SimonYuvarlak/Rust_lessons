# **Student Task: Exploring Control Flow, Ownership, and References in Rust**

#### **Task Overview**

The task involves applying the concepts learned in the "Control Flow, Ownership, and References in Rust" section. You will create a Rust program that demonstrates your understanding of these key aspects.

#### **Task Description**

1. **Develop a Rust Program:**

   - Set up a new Rust project with Cargo to start coding.

2. **Implement Key Features:**

   - **Control Flow Exploration:**

     - Use `if-else` statements to create a program that categorizes a number as "small", "medium", or "large" based on its value.
     - Implement a `for` loop to iterate through an array of integers and sum their values.
     - Create a `loop` that repeatedly asks the user for input until they type "exit". (Hint: Use the `read_line` method for input)

   - **Ownership and Memory Management:**

     - Create a function that takes ownership of a String, modifies it by adding additional text, and then returns it.
     - Demonstrate the use of the `drop` function to explicitly free memory before a variable goes out of scope.

   - **References and Borrowing:**
     - Write a function that takes a mutable reference to a String and appends a specified suffix to it.
     - Show how Rust prevents data races by attempting to create two mutable references to the same data in the same scope.

3. **Expected Output**
   - Your program should compile and run, showcasing each concept through the output. The console should display the results of your control flow logic, ownership transfers, and reference manipulations.

This task is designed to deepen your practical understanding of advanced Rust concepts. It will prepare you for more complex programming scenarios in Rust, focusing on memory safety and efficient code execution. Good luck!
